 tech_wormhole_stabilization_desc:0 "A naturally occurring subspace wormhole is a fickle thing, and its fluctuating energy levels typically make it impossible to travel safely between its linked apertures. There are ways to temporarily stabilize its matrix, however. $tech_wormhole_stabilization_desc_dttr$"
 tech_zero_point_power_desc:1 "These generators extract vacuum energy, providing an almost limitless supply of ship power. There is no more efficient way to generate energy. $tech_zero_point_power_desc_dttr$"

 tech_jump_drive_1_desc:1 "A groundbreaking technological marvel, the Jump Drive shreds the local space-time continuum and rearranges it on the quantum level to be identical to that of the target destination - and thus the ship appears to near-instantly "jump" from system to system. $tech_jump_drive_1_desc_dttr$"

 tech_nanite_repair_system_desc:0 "A highly effective hull auto-repair system comprised of billions of microscopic nanomachines was found among the smoking remains of the Scavenger, and has been repurposed for our uses. Whether the Scavenger pilfered this system from an ancient derelict, or was originally constructed with it remains unknown. $tech_nanite_repair_system_desc_dttr$"
