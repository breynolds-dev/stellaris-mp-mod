###Resources###
sr_tachyon:0 "Tachyonic Particles"
sr_tachyon_desc:0 "Exotic particles that only exist at superluminal speeds. Can be used to augment various forms of faster than light travel."

###

sr_tiberium_green:0 "Green Tiberium"
sr_tiberium_green_desc:0 "A rare and exotic crystal, Tiberium Riparius absorbs the mineral content from anything it touches. Extremely dangerous to all forms of life."

sr_tiberium_blue:0 "Blue Tiberium"
sr_tiberium_blue_desc:0 "Given enough time, Tiberium Riparius eventually matures into the blue Tiberium Vinifera crystal. This type of Tiberium has a much higher mineral density than the more common Riparius strain of Tiberium."

sr_tiberium_liquid:0 "Liquid Tiberium"
sr_tiberium_liquid_desc:0 "An extremely unstable form of Tiberium that has vast energy potential. Every precaution must be used when handling this volatile form of Tiberium in order to avoid planetary catastrophe."
