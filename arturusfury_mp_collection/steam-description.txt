[h1]Arturusfury's Multiplayer Collection[/h1]
Stellaris version supported: v2.1.*

This is mostly a collection of mods with slight alterations to make a multiplayer game faster.  It speeds up just about everything without trying to make it too cheap and easy, all that said it does seem easy ... until pirates wipe you out of the galaxy.
